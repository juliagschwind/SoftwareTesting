## This is a tool to measure the coverage of a test suite. It utilises Soot to instrument the tested code and calculate the coverage. 


To generate the reports, please run the script called "part2.sh" which can be found in the folder "scripts". When you run it you
will need to input 0,1 or 2 depending on which part of the assignment you would like to run. The reports are called stmt_coverage.txt, branch_coverage.txt
and line_coverage.txt. They show the coverage of the Randoop test suites generated by me and also the given test suite "Regression__Test.java". In the file
Coverage Differences.pdf the differences between my task 2-4 and EclEmma are shown.
